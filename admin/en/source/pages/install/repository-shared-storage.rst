UForge Repository on Shared Storage
-----------------------------------

When using shared storage NFS is used to share the information between the various UForge nodes.  To setup the NAS or SAN for the UForge Repository you must create two shared directories, one for the operating system data and the other for all the user data (``My Software`` and images generated).

To setup the shared storage:

	1. Log in to the machine where the NFS server is running

	2. Create the operating system directory, for example: /volume1/DISTROS

		The following NFS options are required::

			*(rw,async,no_wdelay,no_root_squash,insecure_locks,anonuid=0,anongid=0)

	3. Create the user data directory, for example: /volume1/USER_DATA

		The following NFS options are required::

			*(rw,async,no_wdelay,no_root_squash,insecure_locks,anonuid=0,anongid=0)

	4. Check the mount points: 

		.. code-block:: shell

			mount 192.20.777.205:/appstore_qualif_data/ /mnt 
			su - glassfish 
			cd /mnt

	5. Execute the command::

		touch test 

	6. If it returns::

		touch: cannot touch `test': Permission denied 

		Then execute the following commands (as root) 

		.. code-block:: shell

			cd /mnt 
			chown -R tomcat:tomcat . 

	7. Confirm you can create a file on /mnt as user tomcat. Then perform the following:

		.. code-block:: shell

			cd ~ 
			umount /mnt 

	8. Once these directories have been exported, use the UForge Setup Disk to copy all the operating system information to the DISTROS sub-directory. To mount the shared directory on the machine where the UForge Setup Disk is plugged to::

		mount <nfs server ip address>:/volume1/DISTROS /mnt

	Then copy the DISTROS information from the Setup Disk to the shared directory::

		rsync -a â€“-progress <my disk>/DISTROS/ /mnt/DISTROS/

.. note:: It may take up to an hour to copy all of the data.
