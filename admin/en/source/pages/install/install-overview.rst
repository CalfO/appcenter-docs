UForge Installation Overview
============================

To install a fully functioning UForge platform, we provide the following 2 ISOs:

	* UForge Setup ISO â€“ this includes all the necessary elements to have a functioning "UForge in a Box"
	
	* ISO which contains the skeleton of the distribution installers in case you want to create ISO images with UForge. This only needs to be installed if you want to create ISO images.

Before you start deploying UForge, ensure that you have all the following:

	* UForge Setup ISO
	* Your activation credentials (ID and activation key) provided by your vendor
	* Architecture of the deployment (number of nodes and networking topology. See :ref:`network-topology`)
	* The necessary system requirements (see :ref:`storage-sizing`)
	* Your SSL certificates, key and chaining certificates, and all files corresponding to the following entries in ``/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf``:

		- SSLCertificateFile
		- SSLCertificateKeyFile
		- SSLCACertificateFile
		- SSLCertificateChainFile (might be empty)


Installation Steps
------------------

UForge installation has three distinct phases:

Step 1: Install the UForge AppCenter for each node of the platform.

Step 2: Configure UForge AppCenter using the UForge Deployment Wizard.

Step 3: Additional configuration steps, as described in :ref:`further-config-overview`.
