Using Supervisor Mode
---------------------

UForge allows you to login as another user if you have supervisor access. Supervisor access rights are assigned by the UForge administrator. Once you have supervisor rights, you will see the option supervisor access in the top right of the UForge GUI banner.

To log in as another user with supervisor mode: 

  1. Click on ``supervisor mode`` in the top right of the UForge banner.
  2. In the login screen, enter the name of the user you want to log in as. You will note that you do not need to enter a password.
