Listing Appliance Templates
---------------------------

To view the appliance templates you have access to, go to the ``VM Builder`` tab in the user interface.  By default the appliance templates are listed by latest first.

From the ``Appliance Library`` page you can view the appliances that you created, that have been imported (from Collaboration or from the UForge Marketplace if you have access to one), and appliances that you have shared.
