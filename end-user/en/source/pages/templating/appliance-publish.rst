Publishing a Machine Image
--------------------------

In order to publish a machine image to a cloud environment, you must already have credentails to access that environment. 

	1. If not already done, create a new cloud account for the target environment.  For more informatin, see :ref:`account-cloud-accounts` 
	2. Go to the appliance and click the ``Machine Images`` page. If you have not generated a machine image, you will need to do so as described in :ref:`appliance-generate-machine-image`.
	3. Click on the arrow to publish your image.

	.. image:: /images/machine-image-publish.jpg

	4. Following the instructions, choose the cloud account to use and fill in any additional information required.
	5. Click ``publish``.

.. note:: Publishing an image to Amazon will launch an instance and therefore will be billed to the user account. Azure trial accounts are not supported for publishing images from UForge. Only full Azure accounts can be used.
