Generating a Machine Image
--------------------------

You can generate a machine image from an appliance template in the Marketplace.  To do so:

	1. Click on the template you want to generate an image from.
	2. Click on ``generate``.
	3. Select the format of image you want to generate. Enter any last minute configuration.

	.. note:: If you want to ignore dependency checking during image generation (for example because you have knowingly removed a package dependency that is not required in your environment), then you check the option “ignore dependency checking warnings”. Note that this is an advanced option and should not be used systematically.

	4. Click ``generate``.  The image will be visible on the ``Dashboard`` tab, and clicking on the ``Generations`` page.
