To view the appliance templates that are shared in the Marketplace, go to the ``Marketplace`` tab in the user interface.  By default the appliance templates are listed by latest first.

You can sort the appliance templates by clicking on ``Popular`` (based on the number of generations and downloads), ``Highly Rated`` (based on the rating attributed by users) or ``Partners``.

You can view the details of an appliance template, generate images from them and comment on them.
