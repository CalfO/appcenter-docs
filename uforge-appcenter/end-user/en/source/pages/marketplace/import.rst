Importing an Appliance Template
-------------------------------

You can import an appliance that is in the Marketplace to your private appliance library.  This allows you to access and modify the appliance template meta-data; generate an image, as well as share it again.

To import the appliance template from the Marketplace:

	1. Click on the appliance template in the marketplace you want to save to your library.
	2. Click on ``import``.  The template will be added to your appliance library. You can view it under the ``VM Builder`` tab, ``Appliance Library`` > ``Imported Appliances``.
