	3. From the drop-down menus, select the operating system (distribution, release and architecture).
	4. Click the ``Create`` button. This creates a skeleton of an appliance template in the platform which you can now customize with operating system packages, middleware and application software.
	5. You should now see the appliance overview page. You can add a description to your appliance (optional) and a logo (optional). The logo format must be .jpg, .jpeg or .png.
	6. An OS profile is mandatory. See Creating an Operating System Profile. However, you can leave the appliance at this point and edit it later.
	7. If you have made any modifications, click ``save``.
