Installing from a VM Template
------------------------------

A number of virtual machines have already been prepared by UShareSoft to make it easier to install quickly UForge on a virtualized or cloud environment.  If your environment does not support the proposed VM formats, then install UForge using the ISO image, as described in “Installing from an ISO”.

To install UForge from a VM template.

	1. Import the VM to the cloud datastore or public template library.

	2. Use the cloud or virtualization management platform to instantiate one or more instances of the VM template.

	3. Recuperate the console of the newly created VM instance.
	
	4. Accept the licensing agreement.

	5. Choose the keyboard layout you want to use.

	6. Choose the UNIX root user and guest user passwords.

	7. Set the time zone of the VM.

	8. Choose ``Accept All and Continue``.

The installation phase is complete, you are now ready to configure the UForge platform, see :ref:`configure-uforge`.
